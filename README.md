# UCITransit
Android app for UCI shuttle times.

# About
A recreation of my <a href="https://github.com/tripleducke/Capstone-Project">Udacity capstone project</a>, using some popular libraries and frameworks specifically RxJava and Dagger 2. Since it will be rebuilt completely, I will be trying Realm to replace SQLite. Though Realm currently doesn't seem to support geospatial queries, I'm hoping it will either come out soon, or I can implement something to replicate sort-by-distance similary as done in SQLite.

# Libraries & Frameworks
